#PROBLEM STATEMENTS:
National School Water Monitoring System.
#TEAM NAME: The Rise
#Abstract-- 
In the contemporary ecosphere, Water contamination is one of the
foremost reasons for numerous categories of water-borne viruses such as dengue,
cholera and malaria etc., for hominid. 40% of deceases in universal are produced
by water contaminations. So, the eminence of the drinking water wants to be
restrained in real time although it is provided to schools. In this project, we propose
a development and extension of a real time water eminence computing structure at
compact cost using Internet of Things (IoT). To figure out the parameters of the
water such as temperature, pH, turbidity. The centralised arrangement obtains the
monitored standards from several devices over a period of time. Through the WiFi
structure, the sensor output data is sent to the concerned authority for additional
stages to advance the water quality at schools.

UNO model, WI-FI module(ESP32).

IoT based Water Quality Monitoring System
➤In IoT based method ESP32 board with water sensors is used. ESP32 consists of
wifi and bluetooth functionalities. In order to avail GSM/GPRS functionality in the
system, GSM/GPRS board (SIM800A) is interfaced with ESP32 using UART
interface. In case of Arduino Uno other than GSM board one has to interface
wifi/BLE module also as arduino does not have wifi or BLE chip.
➤Water sensor kit consists of many sensors used to measure water quality. These
include pH sensor, temperature sensor, conductivity sensor, dissolved oxygen
sensor and so on.
➤The data collected by sensors from various schools are uploaded to cloud storage
server using wifi.
➤The data are being analyzed using machine learning techniques and appropriate
reports are being generated in different formats.
➤End users of the system can monitor the reports and results of water samples
collected from various locations using mobile or web app developed.
Benefits or Advantages of IoT based Water Quality Monitoring System
Following are the benefits or advantages of IoT based Water Quality Monitoring
System are as follows.
➤The model in tanks are mobile in nature and hence large number of samples are
easily collected from different schools in less time.
➤It is very easy to maintain the IoT based water quality monitoring system as all
the electronic boards are available.
➤The system is very cheap as the hardware and software does not cost much.
➤Machine learning techniques have made it very easy to plot the data collected in
various formats for proper analysis.
➤Cloud storage platforms such as thinkers cloud, azure helps in storing the sensor
data immediately and wirelessly to the robust servers.
